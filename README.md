# Single-Image-Reflection-Removal-Toolkit
This is a Toolkit uses five different models to remove the reflection on single image.The results of the removal (including PSNR/SSIM and the image after reflection removal) will be obtained by using a web-application constructed by flask.

5 IBLNN<br>
  It's a model designed by me. The paper has not been publicted, so I will explain this model in the following paragraphs, thus to let the readers understand the details.

## Toolkit functions
1 Using one image with reflection as input, receiving five images (each uses a different model) as output.<br>

<img src="./img/one_res.png">

2 Using one testset as input(including image with reflection-I, image without reflection-B, residual image-R), receving PSNR/SSIM effects comparison and image after reflection removal as output.<br>

## Toolkit instructions
1 neccesary resources downloading<br>
[Supplment files](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fF4x0eraelU1O1Ank77QSw) code: q5ro<br>
need to put the files into the right position in the toolkit folder<br>

3 tips<br>
When upload a testset to the web application, please change the test data into the right position(just like the example), compress the folder into the .zip format,and rename it to dataset.zip.
